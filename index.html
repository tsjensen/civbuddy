## Welcome to {{ site.name }}.

{{ site.name }} is designed to support players of Francis Tresham's [original Civilization board
game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71/civilization) by helping with the tactical planning when buying
civilization cards in game phase 10.

This is not a computer game, but a helper application for the board game. You need the board game for
{{ site.name }} to be useful to you. In later stages of the game, the game rules lead to phases of long-winded
calculations in the upper three-digit numbers. With {{ site.name }}, this can be solved quickly and easily,
so that everyone can concentrate on all the fun parts of the game.

### Use it like a mobile app

{{ site.name }} is a Web application, but you can use it like a mobile app, which will give it full-screen
support without browser toolbars etc.

On iOS:

1. Open [{{ site.name }}]({{ page.appurl }}) in Safari (yes, it must be Safari, as far as I know).
2. Press the *Share* button (looks like a box with an arrow coming out of it).
3. In the sharing options, choose *Add to Home Screen*
4. This will create an app icon on your phone which runs CivBuddy as if it was a native iPhone app.

On Android:

1. On Android, the process is the same as on iOS, but the *Add to Home Screen* option is in the drop-down
   menu of the Chrome browser.


## Development Setup

This website is primarily intended to centralize development related information.

### Setting up a local development workspace

In order to build {{ site.name }} yourself, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the prerequisites set up:
   - [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
   - [NodeJs and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - The download for Node includes NPM.
1. NodeJs and NPM should be on the PATH.
1. Clone the {{ site.name }} repo by running on the command line:
 
        git clone https://github.com/{{ site.github }}.git

1. `cd civbuddy`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run build`\\
   This will create a {{ site.name }} distributable in *build/dist* that can be used for development.
1. In order to create a version for production, run `npm run hash` in order to create hashed files for
   cache handling and remove source maps.

The {{ site.name }} code as found on GitHub is IDE agnostic, so you may use your favorite IDE to edit the sources.
We use Visual Studio Code, which is why there are some settings for Visual Studio Code. They are not critical to
{{ site.name }} development.
