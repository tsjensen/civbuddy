     * A card was planned or unplanned, so credit assignments may shift.
     *
     * **Algorithm**
     * 1. Find all cards which support the given card (the "ownedGivingCards").
     * 2. For each "ownedGivingCard":
     *    1. Find all cards supported by the "ownedGivingCard" which are PLANNED.
     *    2. Of those planned cards, select the one which receives the most credit (the "winner").
     *    3. Find all cards supported by the "ownedGivingCard" which are NOT OWNED (and thus have a credit bar).
     *    4. For each such non-owned card:
     *       - If the card is the "winner" chosen above, give it the full credit.
     *       - If not, subtract the winner's credit from the given credit (without going below zero) and set that.
     *
     * **Example**
     * 1. HAVE Mysticism
     * 2. PLAN Music (for 55 instead of 60);
     *    This must update the cost of Medicine from 120 to 125 (and many other cards, too)
     * 3. PLAN Medicine (for 125 instead of 140)
     * 4. Buy Medicine and Music for 180 total, using the Mysticism bonus for Medicine
     *    (as it's 20, which is better than the 5 for Music)
     *
     * @param pChangedCardId card ID of the card that changed its state
