# CivBuddy

**Helper app for the original Civilization board game**

CivBuddy is designed to support players of Francis Tresham's [original Civilization board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71/civilization) (1980) by helping with the tactical planning when buying civilization cards. It supports many variants of the game, including [Advanced Civilization](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/177/advanced-civilization) (1991).

This is not a computer game, but a helper application for the board game. In later stages of the game, the rules of the board game lead to phases of long-winded calculations in the upper three-digit numbers. With CivBuddy, this can be solved quickly and easily, so everyone can concentrate on the fun parts of the game.

Please look at the [website](http://civbuddy.org) for more information.

CivBuddy is a free web application, so you can **[just use it right now](http://app.civbuddy.org)!** :+1:
