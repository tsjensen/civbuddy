# CivBuddy (v2)

**Original Civilization Board Game Utility**

CivBuddy is designed to support players of Francis Tresham's
[original Civilization board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71/civilization) (1980)
by helping with the tactical planning when buying civilization cards. It can support multiple variants of the game,
including
[Advanced Civilization](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/177/advanced-civilization) (1991).

This is not a computer game, but a helper application for the board game. In later stages of the game,
the rules of the board game lead to phases of long-winded calculations in the upper three-digit numbers.
With CivBuddy, this can be solved quickly and easily, so everyone can concentrate on the fun parts of the game.

CivBuddy is a free web application, so you can just [use it right now](http://app2.civbuddy.org/)! :tada:

### Status

Ready to use! CivBuddy is feature complete and stable. Should you notice anything wrong or missing, please
leave us a bug report in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/tsjensen/civbuddy/issues).

This is a rewrite of the [old CivBuddy application](https://github.com/tsjensen/civbuddy/tree/v1-gwt)
(now called *v1*), which was based on [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/) technology. The old version is no longer
being maintained.
